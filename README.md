## Project Overview
This project is a turn-based strategy game written in C, managing two players competing across a dynamic grid of cities. 
It uses dynamic memory allocation and pointer-based data structures for efficient state and collision management. 
The Dockerfile provided uses a multi-stage build to compile and run the program inside an isolated Linux container.
