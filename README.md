## Project Overview
A turn-based strategy game written in C where two players compete to take over opponent regions on a dynamic grid. Players deploy people to districts and receive directional intelligence when missing targets. The game uses dynamic memory allocation, pointer-based data structures, and priority queues for efficient state management and optimal search algorithms. Built in C99 with Docker containerization and automated CI/CD through GitHub Actions.
